[LocoWordFinder](https://mfm24.github.io/LocoWordFinder.html)

This is a local anagram solver. It uses Python to create a javascript list, which is then processed in realtime in LocoWordFinder.html to provide anagrams in realtime as the user types.

Wildcards are supported with the '?' character, although they will slow things down if a lot are used.
